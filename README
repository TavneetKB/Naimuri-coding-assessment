This Jupyter notebook pre-processes, analyzes, and forecasts confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases of COVID-19 in 2020. 
It provides interactive visualizations to explore trends and applies time series forecasting models to predict future cases.
This notebook uses Python version 3.11.9.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this notebook are:
- covid_19_data_2020.csv — used for analysis and training of the models.
- time-series-19-covid-combined.csv — used for model validation.

Both datasets are stored in the data folder.

The data includes country-level daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered counts. Some preprocessing is applied to handle missing values, differences in start dates between countries, and zero-case days.

---

## Models
The notebook implements the following forecasting models:
- LSTM: Two LSTM layers with Dropout layers after each LSTM, followed by a Dense layer. The Dense layer uses a ReLU activation to ensure predictions remain non-negative.
- GARCH-LSTM: Combines a GARCH model to capture volatility in daily changes with an LSTM for forecasting. This model allows the neural network to account for periods of high variability in the data.

Fully trained models are saved in the lstm_covid_model/model directory for reuse.

## Input

This contains a JSON file which has a dictionary of regions and countries that have been used for analysis and pre-processing, this avoids the use of large dictionary objects within the notebook.

---

## Example deployment

This folder contains a simple implementation of a deployed LSTM model based on the notebook. It takes in the a country name and a forecast horizon, the interval of interest for forecasting, and returns the predicted confirmed cases for that country using the trained LSTM. Instructions for using this folder can be found in the README within this folder.
