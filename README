## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/TavneetKB/Naimuri-coding-assessment.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
 ```

---

 ## Usage
To run the project, use the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

---

## Dataset
The datasets used in this notebook are:
- covid_19_data_2020.csv — used for analysis and training of the models.
- time-series-19-covid-combined.csv — used for model validation.

Both datasets are stored in the data folder.

The data includes country-level daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered counts. Some preprocessing is applied to handle missing values, differences in start dates between countries, and zero-case days.

---

## Models
The notebook implements the following forecasting models:
- LSTM: Two LSTM layers with Dropout layers after each LSTM, followed by a Dense layer. The Dense layer uses a ReLU activation to ensure predictions remain non-negative.
- GARCH-LSTM: Combines a GARCH model to capture volatility in daily changes with an LSTM for forecasting. This model allows the neural network to account for periods of high variability in the data.

Fully trained models are saved in the models directory for reuse.
